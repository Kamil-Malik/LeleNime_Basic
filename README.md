# LeleNime 

Lelenime is a mobile application developed with the aim of providing access to anime indexes on MAL without having to open a browser and with a better experience. This application was built using the Kotlin programming language and can only be used on the Android-only platform.

Minimum requirement :
1. Android OS
2. API Level 21 / Android Lollipop

How To Install :
1. Download the APK file through my Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YOMn6z9X7SK1jfcOIIDZvEyC5sTrlmwA/view?usp=sharing)
2. Install it with your smartphone package installer
3. Enjoy

Current Feature :
Currently, the application only has 3 menus, namely:
1. Airing Anime - 
This menu will display a list of anime currently airing this season
2. Explore Anime - 
This menu can be used to search for anime by title. This feature has an SFW parameter which can be disabled via the settings menu. However, I am not responsible for the activation of NSFW features
3. My Anime - 
Currently my anime menu only displays a list of anime that you have opened before, and this data is stored offline using a local database. So, the data will be lost when you uninstall the application.

Next Target :
1. Favorites feature
2. Character Details
3. Anime Recommendations
